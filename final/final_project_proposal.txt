Final Project Proposal for Cameron Embree

TITLE: 
Audio analysis and simple classifier


OVERVIEW:
I want to look into audio analysis tools in Mathematica and to use those tools to do a very simple word recognizing method. I want to take a recorded piece of audio and, using mathematica tools, recognize/classify my audio as being closest to a certain word. Some word options, with varying degrees of similarity, include:
- Hello
- World
- Excellent
- Bellow 

LEARNING GOAL:
My capstone senior project has to do with audio collection and recognition so I am curious what options mathematica has built-in for such things. It 'might' be simple to do some basic recognition if mathematica has enough audio feature extraction tools.

PLAN:
1. Look into audio importing
2. Visualize audio to determine how to best extract features
 - What features define a given word
3. Examine available feature extraction possibilities and why each may be useful
4. Record (or find online) audio of 4 different spoken words
5. Run feature extraction on words and see how I might classify a word
 - count of number of spoken peaks in a word
6. Use classification choice to make small method that I can pass my audio file and it will tell me what word it sounds closest to.

OUTCOME:
Pass a few recorded piece of audio for single words and label each audio piece as belonging to the correct word by analayzing extracted features from each pice of audio
